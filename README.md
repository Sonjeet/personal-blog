# Personal Blog

## Motivations
I initially wanted to learn about the JAMStack which got me into Gatsby. After some more research I realised that static site generators like Gatsby or Gridsome are perfect
to create blogs.

- Developed with Gatsby
- CMS with Netlify CMS
- Served by Netlify

## Pending features
