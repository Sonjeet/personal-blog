# Personal Blog

## Motivations
I initially wanted to learn about the JAMStack which got me into Gatsby. After some more research I realised that static site generators like Gatsby or Gridsome are perfect
to create blogs.

- Developed with Gatsby
- CMS with Netlify CMS
- Served by Netlify

## Pending features
- Subscription / mailing list
- Add a contact page
- Add an about page
- Implement a comments section using FaaS (similar to how Smashing Magazing have written their comments section logic)
- Let me know of anything you think I should add by contacting me on the socials below and I can add it to my [roadmap](https://app.asana.com/0/1165078116944169/board)

## Design
Before developing the blog, I chose to create a high fidelity wireframe of the main pages. It's worth noting that I struggled with time to add a mobile design as my dissertation was occupying the majority of my time. If anyone is interested in looking at the wireframes then click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_0xHsGMYn01sBZWdxk96Olxu1CJMjZIK/view?usp=sharing).
