# Personal Blog [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4904a628-52c7-416e-9f5c-0b624f17bd71/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sonjblogs/deploys)

## Motivations

I initially wanted to learn about the JAMStack which got me into Gatsby. After some more research I realised that static site generators like Gatsby or Gridsome are perfect
to create blogs.

- Developed with Gatsby
- CMS with Netlify CMS
- Served by Netlify

## Pending features

They're all listed in the github issues for this repo at the moment.

## Design

Before developing the blog, I chose to create a high fidelity wireframe of the main pages. It's worth noting that I struggled with time to add a mobile design as my dissertation was occupying the majority of my time. If anyone is interested in looking at the wireframes then click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_0xHsGMYn01sBZWdxk96Olxu1CJMjZIK/view?usp=sharing).

It's worth noting that the design was created a few weeks before I started development. By the time I started to develop things, I had some brief changes in mind in terms of how the design should be.
