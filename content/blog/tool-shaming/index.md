## What is tool shaming?

If you've ever done some research for choosing a language or framework for your next project you'll most likely have seen comments online that resemble something like this:

> If you choose PHP to write this service, you don't belong here.

This is tool shaming. I see it as an attack on an individual for developing with a certain technology which is not okay. And yes, if you are wondering, that quote is real and it's from a DevOps event in London hosted by Facebook. It's not like the majority of Facebook's code base was built up on PHP... ðŸ˜¶

A lot of material from this short blog post will be related to a talk by James Seconde which goes into a lot more detail so I recommend checking out his work for more enlightenment on the issue.

## Problems it causes

The quote I used above was a very extreme example of tool shaming. Most cases of tool shaming look something like this:

> You use tool X, for that reason I do not respect your skills as a developer

You see this all the time on places like Reddit and Stack Overflow. All you're doing with that statement is mocking someone's career. If this isn't something you want to experience yourself then don't say it to others.

This causes a lot of problems. For example, there are more people than ever trying to teach themselves how to code and when they see comments like "*Angular is s**t"* or "*You're not a developer if you work with Wordpress"* then that will affect the way they think. People can start to think that just because there are preconceptions that you shouldn't use a technology means you should *never* use it. When in reality, that technology was initially created to solve a problem. If you don't have a use case for a certain technology then that's fine, but don't discourage others from using it because you may not fully understand their project requirements. 

Another form of tool shaming that I don't understand are meaningless debates that do not affect the quality of a finished application. These can be things like:

- Vim vs Emacs
- Tabs vs Spaces
- Linux v Windows

Personally, I encourage people to optimise their development environment but something that's always confused me is when I see people debating over things like Vim or Emacs. If it doesn't affect the quality of your application then I don't think we should be holding debates for it. It can promote a toxic environment for new developers which shouldn't really be exposed to that. Think about it, if a new developer is still trying to figure out what language or stack they want to focus on, the last thing they need is someone trying to enforce their own ideologies on them. Don't do something because you've been told *"that's the way we do things"*.

## Complaining about tools is okay though...

Something I want to make clear is that tool shaming is about mocking people for using a certain technology or actively discouraging someone from adopting it. The truth is you don't have an understanding of someone else's app requirements and so you shouldn't be commenting negatively on their tech stack.

However, I don't have any opposition to highlighting advantages or disadvantages of a framework. If a library like jQuery doesn't meet all your requirements then don't use it. But make that decision based off of research and not because an online community is bantering it off. In the JavaScript ecosystem there are so many libraries and frameworks being released at a fast rate so it's even more important that you do your research.
