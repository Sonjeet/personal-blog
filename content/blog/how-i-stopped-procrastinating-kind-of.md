# Setting The Scene

For some reason whenever I have very little to do in my schedule, I just seem to take forever to accomplish my tasks. It doesn't matter whether they're simple or challenging. As a final year university student, there tends to always be a few deadlines looming in my calendar but it takes me **forever** to complete these assignments. Except when I've left it last minute for me to do on the day of the deadline.

But guess what?! I always manage to get the assignment done, which for the most part is done at a good standard and I normally receive the highest classification of marks that you can get in UK universities; a first-class mark. Now this led me to ask the question, **why did it take so long to do these assignments?** I had 4 weeks to do it, I probably progressed through 20% of the work until the deadline, in which case I completed the remaining 80% on the deadline day. I do not want to stroke my own ego but I need to share that I do not find these assignments too challenging, although there are exceptions... I'm looking at you concurrency module.

# The Answer?

I realised that I take too much time to complete something when I have too much time allocated to do something. Whereas, when I'm constrained by time, I tend to blitz through the work. So the solution's simple isn't it? Pack your schedule with things to do and limit each task to a certain time frame. I've tried this over the past few weeks and the results have been great.

I've achieved all of this already:

* Conducted a large amount of research and wrote up about it with a few thousand words in my dissertation
* Develop a blogging site using technologies that I'd never experienced before
* 'Learn' video editing
* Publish 2 YouTube videos related to software development
* Design low fidelity and high fidelity prototypes of my final year computer science project

I have to admit though, some things have gotten away from me. I was meant to learn logo design and animation to create an intro for my YouTube videos. But I guess that'll have to wait for later.

Due to me having an overly packed schedule, I'm now having to ensure that work gets completed on time. Otherwise the consequences are severe; in my opinion. I really do want to do my logo and animation since I have the depiction of it in my head, but it's my own fault for not being able to accomplish it. I can always do it in the summer though.

If you're wondering, I do make sure to fit slots into my schedule for breaks which may consist of napping, cooking, listening to some Joe Rogan... anything that relaxes me really. As long as it's not work, I can do it during my breaks. I really think I've discovered a system that works for me, it's just a shame that it took me 3 years of studying computer science to figure it out.

# Current Schedule

I don't really have a schedule. I have a high level overview of what I want to accomplish during the week. But I plan each day the night before, because as I already mentioned, things do tend to slip away from you if you're attempting to cram in loads of tasks. Due to this, I've found it best to have an adaptable approach to planning my time.

# Sounds Like Bull$h\*\*

Perhaps. Most likely. Truth be told, I don't really know and it might just be a placebo effect since I keep telling myself 'You can do it' when things get tough. All I know is that it's working for me. We're all different though so I'd urge you to work out a system tailored to how you work. Also, be sure to pack your schedule with things that you enjoy too. I see so many people doing things they don't enjoy such as filling out spreadsheets for a living.

I genuinely love coding, it's literally a super power in disguise. I love helping others and teaching them, although this sounds very cheesy, it is true. A lot of my experience in industry has been writing curriculum for a web development bootcamp and teaching there on occasion. This passion for teaching has led me to start a blog and YouTube channel which may be why I'm committed to putting the time in for them.

# Please Help Me Out!

If anything I've mentioned here in this article is a common way of working then please send me more info on it at [sonj.paul@gmail.com](mailto:sonj.paul@gmail.com); I need to develop a comments section, I know! Anyways, I want to explore this approach to working more if it is a real thing, that way I can hopefully learn how to become more efficient. So far I've not found much luck into finding others that use this strategy.

Just remember, if you pack your schedule, you might not get everything done. **But** you're guaranteed to get some of your various tasks complete. Compare this to the alternative which is keeping a schedule with minimal tasks that are spread over a few days or weeks. Yeah, you will probably complete these tasks, but think about how much more things you could accomplish during that same time frame.
