## Why start a blog

At the time of writing I'm currently in my last few months of university and I'm reflecting on my time here. Once my first semester ended I realised that computer science (my course) was not my passion and rather it was writing software that I was interested in. This led me to skip classes in order for me to learn skills that would be more valuable in my software career such as architecting micro services or managing state on the client side.

I've learnt a lot over the past few years and I just wish that I had documented my journey. For what it's worth, my journey looks something like this so far:

- 2012 - Wrote my first ever line of **HTML** & **CSS** and chose Dreamweaver as my go to IDE
- 2016 - I decided to *finally* start writing **JavaScript**(which for some reason I was always scared to learn). I landed my first internship before starting university with the awesome guys at [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) and learnt about **TDD**
- 2017 - I learnt about frameworks and started using **jQuery** and **Bootstrap** to solve a lot of my frontend problems
- 2018 - I picked up **React** and fell in love with its declarative syntax; I found this to be a better experience than having to write DOM manipulation
- 2019 - Took a journey down **server-side development** with **Node** and solidified my understanding of *microservices*, *authentication, databases* and more

Now it's 2020 and I want to start writing about my experiences in software. I think it'd be interesting for me to have a look back at in 10 years time and see how far I've come. 

## Why not just use Medium?

Blogging platforms like [medium](https://medium.com/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/) have great communities in my opinion but I recently got interested in the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) and learnt about the benefits that static site generators like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) brings in terms of developer experience and user experience. So I used this as an opportunity to learn about Gatsby and develop a blogging site for myself. 

## How did you make this

- Developed in Gatsby
- CMS from Netlify CMS
- Served by Netlify

Learn more by following the Gatsby [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/blog-netlify-cms-tutorial/) to create a blog or have a look at my [source code](https://github.com/Sonjeet/personal-blog). I haven't completed everything I wanted for this site yet, ideally I'd like to add a section for readers to post comments amongst other small features too.

## Follow me

So I would've loved for there to have been a subscription service/mailing list for this site but it might take me a while to start developing those features. For now feel free to follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sonj_98) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonjeet/). Until next time üëã
